The goal of this project is to build a model that might mimic human behavior on a decision-making task.

I'll add the details of the task here soon but until then refer to the file in this repo `poster_CNS_2021.pdf`.

You can also play with gym environment for this task in the `gym` folder. See `example.ipynb` to see how.
